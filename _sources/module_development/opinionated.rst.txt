Opinionated
===========

This is an opinionated view of module development and there will undoubtedly be many who disagree. This is *my* approach. If you like it then I have tried to make it accessible, if you don't like it that's fine as FoundryVTT allows many approaches to developing modules.

But Organic

Words to live by. This documentation reflects my current thinking. It mas changed, will change, and will certainly be at odds with the opinions of others.

A Word on Testing
-----------------

One of the things that struck me about the FoundryVTT Module ecosystem was the lack of any evident testing. It may be that some developers have tests that they maintain outside their module's version control (weird) or it may be that they perform only manual tests. Either way this was not something I wanted to ignore.

A few brief enquiries resulted in very little information on how others did (or even *if* they did) any testing. This resulted in the `Module Framework <https://github.com/ulenarofmondarth/module-framework>`_, a reference framework for developing FoundryVTT Modules.

Essentially, I believe modules that have good tests are ultimately higher quality and easier to maintain. At the same time, I acknowledge that this approach can seem heavy handed for smaller modules.
