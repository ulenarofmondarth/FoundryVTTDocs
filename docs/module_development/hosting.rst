Hosting Your Module
===================

By 'hosting' I mean 'where to store your module sources and deploy your module package from'. This has the potential to be politically charged among developers. There are infinite possibilities, among them `Gitlab <https://gitlab.com>`_, `Github <https://github.com>`_, or self-hosting. (Even now a thousand voices re crying out "what about ...?" as  I missed their favourite from this list.) I am taking a pragmatic approach. Most modules seem to use Github. It is free, offers all the facilities we need, and is reasonably stable (the downsides being largely political, you may object to Microsoft's involvement or the potential that they use your code to trail their AI etc.). For most things I will use Github.
