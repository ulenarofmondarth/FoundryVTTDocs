Developing Code in Modules
--------------------------

Although dated these remain a good starting point for current (v12) developers:

* Dated (v0.8.8) but a reasonable primer on developing a module from scratch `Foundry VTT Module Making for Beginners <https://hackmd.io/@akrigline/ByHFgUZ6u/%2FF4CFuxqZSTOcqgixEf9M6A>`_.
* Dated (v9) but a sound starting point for figuring out FoundryVTT internals and module develotment `Getting Started with Package Development <https://foundryvtt.wiki/en/development/getting-started-with-development>`_.
